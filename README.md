Databases - class projects
This project is based on the idea of building an application that allows users to plan outdoor adventure trips with friends. The application allows users to:
1. Create a profile
2. Create adventures, or trips
3. Add tribes, or activity preferences, to their profiles
4. Create and populate packing lists
5. Upload photos from a trip
